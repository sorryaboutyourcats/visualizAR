# Quest AR visualizer for OP-Z test

[Looks like this](https://twitter.com/SryAbtYourCats/status/1714389247635988584)

Currently you'll need [Virtual Desktop](https://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/2017050365004772&ref=oculus_desktop) to enable passthrough (Streaming tab).
From Virtual Desktop, open SteamVR. On your PC open the project in Unity, then click play on Unity.

I got the sprites in a better spot by moving them during play mode, copying the settings, stopping, then pasting them.
There might be a better way, but for meow that is the ghetto magic I casted upon it.

I'd love for this to handle the passthrough on its own, as well as the ability to move and save the sprite locations with your hand. 
We'll see what happens! 😹

///// below is the original readme.. disregard for meow
